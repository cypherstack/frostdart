## Unreleased

* Pin Rust 1.99.1. Earlier toolchains strip Apple dynamic libraries with a misaligned `__LINKEDIT` string pool, which iOS 27 and macOS 27 refuse to load.

## 0.3.0

* Build Rust automatically with native assets (Dart 3.13+, Rust 1.90.0).
* Replace `FrostdartBindings` with generated `@Native` functions; public wrappers remain available.

## 0.0.1

* TODO: Describe initial release.
